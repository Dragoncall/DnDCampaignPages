The many climates present on one huge landmass gift the citizens of this continent a plethora of produce. The deep caverns under the Virruk mountains supply the continent with gems and ores, while the farming communities around the Shiram and Zamnesia forest produce wheat and wood for the rest of the empire. In the West, the large Esmor Desert fills the landmass with sand. A couple of villages lie in this desolate landscape and focus on fashion and manufactures of all kinds of products. In the east, the great Ergalon Tundra compresses the ice essence. The region is focused on seal hunting and other hunting and fishing activities. In the south, Verkenarch stands proud as the largest outpost erected during the Arcanis Mortem. Thanks to the proximity to the sea in practically every village, many harbours have been constructed to transport the goods over the continent.</p>",
